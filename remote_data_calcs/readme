This directory contains scripts to process remotely sensed ocean temperature data from NASA/JPL. The data is hosted on a NASA server in .zarr format
The scripts in this directory should be run after the scripts in the logger_processing directory. They should be run in the order:

1) SST.py
2) peak_temp.py
3) weekly_diff.py
