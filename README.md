This repo contains scripts used in data analysis for the manuscript 
*Fine resolution satellite sea surface temperatures capture the conditions experienced by corals at monthly but not daily time scales* (Bos & Pinsky). 

Repo contents:
Logger_processing folder contains scripts to standardize data and calculate temperature metrics for various *in situ* temperature logger datasets.

Remote_data_calcs folder contains scripts to calculate temperature metrics from NASA/JPL Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) Sea Surface Temperature dataset.

Analysis_and_figs folder contains scripts to run all linear models, make all figures in the manuscript and supplementary material, and calculate other miscellaneous stats 
(Pearson's r, Kruskil-Wallis F, etc.) mentioned in the manuscript. 
This folder also contains a copy of the fully processed logger data with in situ and remotely sensed temperature metrics in .csv form.
